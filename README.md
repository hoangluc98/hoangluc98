## 💡 A bit about me

I'm a code-slinging, UI-polishing, pixel-perfecting **Frontend Engineer** who enjoys crafting beautiful, user-friendly web apps. Whether it’s a sleek landing page or a high-performance dashboard, I’m all about building UIs that *feel right*.

When I’m not wrangling components or chasing down those elusive CSS bugs, you’ll find me:

🏓 **Serving aces in table tennis**  
🏸 **Smashing birdies in badminton**  
🤖 Or tinkering with side projects for fun (and maybe fortune)
